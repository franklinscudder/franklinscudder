- 👋 Hi, I’m @franklinscudder
- 👀 I’m interested in Machine Learning, Simulation and Modelling, Audio Processing, Quantum Computing, PenTesting/CTFs and of course anything that flies!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about quantum computing and trying to expand my mathematical and programming horizons, burrowing deep into any engineering rabbit-hole I find!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on testing, improving and expanding QutiePy!
- 📫 How to reach me email me at findlaytel@gmail.com
